This webpage was produced by Sharon Chen, Olivia Mintz, and Sean Ayoub.

The design for this website and its interactive elements were inspired by the ESPN story "The NFL Head Coaching Carousel".

This article looks at winners of the Big Four Awards at the Grammys over the past few years. Users are able to click through each category in an 
interactive carousel that rotates through each of the winners. Entries for Song of the Year and Record of the Year also include the full audio from
the track that won which will play when clicked. Furthermore, when the user hovers over the artist's image, a short description will pop up. As the user
moves through the carousel, information is displayed underneath which describes both the context of their win in pop culture as well as a list of the
other artists who were nominated in that category. Overall, this page hopes to explore recent trends in music and the award winners at the Grammys.
